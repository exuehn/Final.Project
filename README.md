# Final.Project



level three
words are from the first www webpage

why does it have to be a game?
is it a game?
it wasnt supposed to be a game, it was just suppose to be an interative interface where users experiment with the norms of using interfaces
its kinda like a game cuz the definition of game is where there is interaction using an input. the point where it differs is that a game has progression and consequences, there is a series of levels but there are no consequences if you cant finish it. i see it as more of an artistic project that reveals the way we made ourselves to cater to the devices and interfaces we are using
why are we always

it is a medium to encourage moments of realisation
to emphasise and show the links between the physical and the input hardware

the project is coded this way because i am the coder
it is easier and more efficient for me to code
exploring the power and control
i force users to navigate through my project in my convinience


bringing physicality into the scnene, exploring why we were in the position of how we use 
changing how we use the physical interfaces
flipping the mouse around
turning the keyboard upside down
face your laptop away from you
stand while playing
hold your laptop up
