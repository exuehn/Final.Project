why does it have to be a game?
is it a game?
it wasnt supposed to be a game, it was just suppose to be an interative interface where users experiment with the norms of using interfaces
its kinda like a game cuz the definition of game is where there is interaction using an input. the point where it differs is that a game has progression and consequences, there is a series of levels but there are no consequences if you cant finish it. i see it as more of an artistic project that reveals the way we made ourselves to cater to the devices and interfaces we are using

it is a medium to encourage moments of realisation
to emphasise and show the links between the physical and the input hardware

the project is coded this way because i am the coder
it is easier and more efficient for me to code
exploring the power and control
i force users to navigate through my project in my convinience


bringing physicality into the scnene, exploring why we were in the position of how we use 
changing how we use the physical interfaces
flipping the mouse around
turning the keyboard upside down
face your laptop away from you
stand while playing
hold your laptop up

the typing level
depending on screen size, the position of textboxes changes
sometimes it would block the screen
its because its the easiest way i found to code it, it doesnt align with the canvas but the html page
shows how we are suppose to code in a way that the computer understands, comprimising ourselves for the computer


originally didnt thought about doing random levels
but then questioning the theme of control, i want it more of between the computer and the user
whatever i can make it random where the computer decide, i will let that happen
